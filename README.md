# iPM-ODE
iPM-ODW is a simple Python applet to use with population models based on differential equations. Important model parameters can be modified on the fly by updating simulation results.  
The applet is still very much a work in progress but completely functional for Lotka-Volterra (`interactiveLV.py`), Rosenzweig-Macarthur (`interactiveRM.py`) and one example for a more extended food web (`interactiveFoodWeb.py`).  
Future implementations will include a drop-down menu for various important population models to switch between models on the go.  
iPM-ODE is designed for research and education simultaneously and the extension of the app with custom models is very straightforward.
