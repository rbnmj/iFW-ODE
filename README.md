# iFW-ODE
iFW-ODW is a simple python applet to use with food webs based on differential equations. Important model parameter can be modified on the fly with updating simulation results.  
The applet is still very much work in progress but completely functional for Lotka-Volterra (`interactiveLV.py`), Rosenzweig-Macarthur (`interactiveRM.py`) and one example for a more extended food web (`interactiveFoodWeb.py`).  
It is planned to realize a drop down menu for various important population models to switch between models on the go.  
iFW-ODE is designed for research and education simultaneously and extension of the app with custom models is very straight forward.
